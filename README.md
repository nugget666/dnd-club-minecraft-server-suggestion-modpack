this is just to review my progress in creating this modpack. you look, you go through the mods, if you have a problem with one or a suggestion to add, you can dm me on discord. i dont know if this is the modpack we're using, but i have a feeling it might be. mainly because its pretty close to done and custom tailored to this specific group of people (i went through the mod suggestions channel and followed a pattern). im also consistenly testing the modpack to ensure compatibility, not-be-op-and-break-the-game-ability, and most of all: fun :D! P.S. im making this to help out addison who's overseeing the creation of the server and ethan ni. who's running it. i have no actual power.
